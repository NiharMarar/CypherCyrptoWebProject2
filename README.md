# CypherCryptoWebsite
# Main.py
This is where the flask runs and where we run all of our python code in our website. We were able to use our python code for the ciphers and run them on the website without having to use html. The main.py also runs everything with the app.routes. Very important for our website.  

# Binary
Binary is the 3rd option on the navigation bar.
<br/>
Binary is basically just a bunch of 1s and 0s combined. This code has functions, variables, input/output, loops, print statements,as well as a couple visuals. This code also holds several html tags(<>) such as p, h, b, etc. A bunch of tags to make up a website. It also contain several html files where we added a background picture, images, and the buttons for the game. This code does the decryption and encryption part of the project for Binary only. It however can't encrypt/decrypt spaces. It can't be fixed, so we recommend doing one word or if multiple words, don't space them. If you do space them, space=100000 

# Caesar Cipher
Caesar Cipher is the 2nd option on the navigation bar.
<br/>
The Caesar Cipher is a cipher that encrypts letters with a shift pattern. So "A" with a shift pattern of 1 would be "B" and so on. Same applies with negative numbers as well. There are separate parts for both capitol letters and lowercase letters in the ascii library and it's very important to make sure that it is separate. Same thing applies for decryption except decryption is much harder. This code does the decryption and encryption part of the project for Caesar Cipher only. This code contains functions, loops, input/output, print statements, variables, arrays, and lists. It also has a visual. The Caesar Cipher html files also contaion html tags(<>) which help build the website and structure the website. We were able to use flask and "POST" to run our previous python code, and we were able to add images and videos and change colors as well. Adding a background color was also a hassle as we had to find a good enough picture to fit well.  

# RSA
RSA is the 4th option on the navigation bar. 
RSA is one of the first public-key cryptology and is widely used for secure data transmission. The acronym RSA is the initial letters of the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977. A user of RSA creates and then publishes a public key based on two large prime numbers, along with an auxiliary value. The prime numbers must be kept secret. More often, RSA passes encrypted shared keys for symmetric key cryptography which in turn can perform bulk encryption-decryption operations at much higher speed. It's a little similar to the Ceaser Cipher as well. The code has a few similarities too. This code does the decryption and encryption part of the project for RSA only. This code contains functions, loops, input/output, print statements, variables, arrays, and lists. It has a visual too. The html files also contains background pictures, html tags(<>), textbox, buttons, and runs its code from the main.py.
